Functionality Expectations Achieved:
-----------------------------------------------

Sets of Test Projects (out of 6): 5

Comments on sets of Test Projects: 6 Test projects provided (team-104/phaseC/BlackSheep/src/test/testfolders) however, the same cannot be tested as UI doesn't let more than one submissions. 

Comments on Functionality Expectations: "UI Hosted at: http://blacksheep.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/templates/welcome.html
UI needs some work in terms of overall look and feel (all pages should have back buttons/navigational views, home is needed on many pages, background color and fonts need more balance, button labels should be clearer). Login only works for the Username ""mike"", needs to work for any username given from UI or in database. Upload and code stuff also only works for ""mike"". File Match just shows numbers for that one submission which are not helpful to the user, need to show percentage of plagiarism against students in the class in a tabular format. Say if there are 30 students in a class, the instructor should be able to input 30 submissions (where 1 submission = 1 student), either via folder or zip files or git repos or some other strategy. That is then run against the system and results shown in a tabular format. The most plagiarized student pairs should come on the top. You may then give the user the option/button to see side-by-side comparison for each student-pair (a row in the table) if needed in an additional window."


Stretches Achieved:
-----------------------------------------------

(1) Stretch (small): employs more than one comparison strategy on demand. Hint: use the strategy pattern., (2) Stretch (bigger): uses more than one comparison strategy and reports the results of each method
Stretch (even bigger): uses more than one comparison strategy and computes an overall score using a weighted polynomial function.	

Comments: "Did not attempt MOSS. Multiple submissions not working. 
Other stretches done as per requirement but needs refinement. For ""Uses more than one comparison strategy and reports the results of each method"", it only shows counts for each strategy but not the percentages, the data seems to be present in the JSON, however, the same was not shown in the UI."
